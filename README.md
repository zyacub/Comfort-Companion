# Comfort-Companion (DEPRECIATED, AS TWILIO SHUT DOWN THE AUTOPILOT SERVICE :( )
AI based mental health textline to increase accessibility to resources

Comfort Companion uses TWILIO autopilot along with a MYSQL database to store the resources. Back end is coded entirely in JavaScript and is included in the functions/functions.js file

The intents.js is the downloaded file from my twilio autopilot service that shows the phrases and intents that the NLP model is trained with. Youll have to export these into your own twilio autopilot service in order to run the program yourself.

To see a demo of the text line in action, text START to +1 (334) 212-5686
